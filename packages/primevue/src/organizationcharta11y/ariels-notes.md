# What is this?

A fun lil playground for me to explore Vue development and potentially make the world a tiny bit more accessible.

## The Goal

Re-implement the OrganizationChart component so it has a nested list based implementation, instead of a table.

## The Why

When I was building a [web app to display my dog's pedigree](https://arielrezinn.github.io/pedigree/), I learned a lot about what goes in to making a tree-like diagram accessible. I also discovered that there was no pre-existing tree/org chart component with a nested list implementation. I made do with what I could find, but ended up unsatisfied with the final project and its accessibility.

More recently, I was navigating a web app that displays various role and career progressions within an IT department, and thought "huh, I could make this so much better if I threw together a quick little Vue app to present the data".

The problem- I need to represent data in a tree structure, and the preexisting PrimeVue component isn't very accessible to screenreader users. If only there was a nested list based implementation!

## The How

Who knows if this code will ever see the light of day. I am busy with a million other things in life, but I'm hoping to poke away at this here and there.
